# Introduction

Design entire lives for the NPCs:
- What education they may have
- Their intelligence (if they are too smart, drug them stupid)
- What wives / husbands / kids they might have
- Houses
- Money

Also design some big happy events:
- If they are at a certain age, let's say, just randomly, 36? Then start embedding that number everywhere. Have that NPC look it up to make him think big great things are coming to make him all happy!
